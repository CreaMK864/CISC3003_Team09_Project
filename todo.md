# Chatbot Website Project - TODO Checklist

## 1. Project Setup & Basic Backend Framework
- [x] **Repository & Structure**
  - [x] Create a new repository.
  - [x] Set up the folder structure with:
    - Root directory.
    - `main.py` file.
    - `requirements.txt` file.
    - `Dockerfile` for deployment.
- [ ] **Basic FastAPI App**
  - [ ] Initialize a FastAPI application in `main.py`.
  - [ ] Add a simple `/health` endpoint returning JSON (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`).
  - [ ] Set up Uvicorn to run the app when executing `main.py`.

## 2. Database Integration & Data Modeling
- [ ] **Update Dependencies**
  - [ ] Add SQLModel and the necessary PostgreSQL driver (e.g., asyncpg or psycopg2) to `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] **Database Connection Module**
  - [ ] Create a `database.py` module.
  - [ ] Configure database connection using SQLModel.
- [ ] **Data Models**
  - [ ] Define the `User` model with fields: id, email, display_name, profile_picture_url, password_hash, last_selected_model.
  - [ ] Define the `Conversation` model with fields: id, user_id, title, timestamps, and selected model.
  - [ ] Define the `Message` model with fields: conversation_id, sender (user/bot), content, timestamp.
- [ ] **CRUD Endpoints/Functions**
  - [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations to test model creation and retrieval.
  - [ ] Integrate these endpoints or internal functions into the FastAPI app.

## 3. Supabase Authentication Integration
- [ ] **Auth Dependencies**
  - [ ] Ensure necessary libraries (like httpx) are added to the dependencies.
- [ ] **Auth Module**
  - [ ] Create an `auth.py` module.
  - [ ] Implement user registration endpoint (email, password, display name).
  - [ ] Implement user login endpoint that retrieves a token from Supabase.
  - [ ] Create a route to check the current session/token and return user profile information.
- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Wire the authentication endpoints into your main FastAPI app.
  - [ ] Ensure that user data integrates well with the defined User model.

## 4. Real-Time Chat with WebSockets
- [ ] **WebSocket Endpoint**
  - [ ] Create a WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `/ws/chat`) in your FastAPI app.
- [ ] **Message Handling**
  - [ ] Implement functionality to receive chat messages from clients.
  - [ ] Send responses (or stream responses) back to the client.
- [ ] **Database Integration**
  - [ ] Store incoming chat messages in the database using the Message model.
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Add basic error handling and reconnection strategies in the WebSocket endpoint.

## 5. Frontend Basic Setup & HTML/CSS/JS Structure
- [ ] **Static Files Setup**
  - [ ] Create a `static` or `public` directory.
- [ ] **Basic HTML Page**
  - [ ] Build an `index.html` file that includes:
    - A chat area.
    - An input field for sending messages.
    - A sidebar for navigation (to be extended later).
- [ ] **CSS Styling**
  - [ ] Write minimal CSS to style the chat interface (mobile-first and responsive).
- [ ] **JavaScript Integration**
  - [ ] Write JS code to:
    - Connect to the WebSocket endpoint.
    - Send messages from the input field.
    - Display received messages in the chat area.
- [ ] **Backend Serving**
  - [ ] Configure FastAPI to serve static files.

## 6. Markdown Rendering & Enhanced UI
- [ ] **Markdown Parser Integration**
  - [ ] Include a markdown parser library (e.g., marked.js) in your HTML page.
- [ ] **Syntax Highlighting**
  - [ ] Integrate a syntax highlighting library (e.g., highlight.js) for code blocks.
- [ ] **Update JS Code**
  - [ ] Modify JS to parse incoming chat messages as markdown.
  - [ ] Render formatted messages including highlighted code blocks.
- [ ] **UI Testing**
  - [ ] Verify that the UI remains responsive on mobile and desktop devices.

## 7. Multi-Page Navigation (History, Profile, Subscription, Settings)
- [ ] **Additional Pages**
  - [ ] Create HTML pages for:
    - Conversation History (with infinite scrolling, inline renaming, deletion with confirmation).
    - User Profile (view and edit profile info).
    - Subscription Simulation (display subscription status and plan details).
    - Settings/Configuration (options for language preference, notifications, etc.).
- [ ] **Navigation Integration**
  - [ ] Update the sidebar or main navigation to enable switching between pages.
- [ ] **Backend Connections**
  - [ ] Ensure each page integrates with the corresponding backend endpoints (e.g., conversation data, user profile updates).

## 8. Error Handling, Logging & Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Enhance HTTP endpoints with comprehensive error handling and proper HTTP status codes.
  - [ ] Improve WebSocket error handling and client notifications.
- [ ] **Logging**
  - [ ] Integrate Pythonâ€™s logging module to log important events and errors.
- [ ] **Security Measures**
  - [ ] Enforce HTTPS and secure session token management.
  - [ ] Secure passwords by using bcrypt (or similar) for hashing.
  - [ ] Implement basic CSRF protections where necessary.
- [ ] **Final Validation**
  - [ ] Review and test all endpoints for robust error handling and security compliance.

## 9. Dockerization & Deployment Setup
- [ ] **Dockerfile**
  - [ ] Update or create a `Dockerfile` that:
    - Copies the application code.
    - Installs all dependencies.
    - Exposes the required port.
    - Launches the FastAPI app with Uvicorn.
- [ ] **docker-compose Setup**
  - [ ] Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for:
    - The FastAPI application service.
    - A PostgreSQL service linked properly to the backend.
- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  - [ ] Parameterize database URLs, Supabase configuration, and other sensitive settings.
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Ensure the full stack (backend, database, frontend) runs within containers.

## 10. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions Integration
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - [ ] Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that:
    - Checks out the repository.
    - Sets up a Python environment and installs dependencies.
    - Runs unit and integration tests.
    - Builds the Docker image.
    - Optionally pushes/deploys the Docker image.
- [ ] **Validation**
  - [ ] Verify that each push triggers the CI/CD pipeline and that tests pass successfully.

# Additional Notes
- Regularly commit progress to your repository.
- Test each feature thoroughly before integrating the next set of tasks.
- Ensure seamless integration of frontend and backend functionalities.
- Update this checklist as the project evolves or new tasks are identified.
